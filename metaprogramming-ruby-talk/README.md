# Metaprogramming in Ruby

This is a presentation built using [iPython
Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) that covers
Metaprogramming in Ruby.

If you choose to run the notebook (you'll need iPython installed), I highly recommend
checking out a plugin for iPython called
[Rise](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE). This will allow you to give a
[Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) style presentation, but instead of manually coding your slides, you build
them  using an iPython Notebook. This allows you to use both Markdown and
interactive [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)s to give a presentation. It's super powerful.

Enjoy!

## Intentionally Left Out Topic

I do not talk about Singleton Methods or Eigenclasses. Those concepts cover a
good chunk of metaprogramming in Ruby, but they are in my opinion the most
confusing concepts to master and I've never ran into a situation where using
them would have made my code much better. Thus I chose to avoid them altogether,
but if you're interested in learning more there are tons of articles about them.
